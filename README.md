# first-research
This research aims to see how real-time (dynamically) updated scarcity information along with its congruity with social cues affect consumer behavior.
The HTMLs here are intended to emulate actual OTA(online travel agency) websites.
For study 1, we have 3 conditions. "Control" for absence of scarcity information, "Static" for not-changing scarcity information, "Dynamic" for changing scarcity information(real-time).
(1) For study 2, we have 3 conditions. "Control" for real-time scarcity information, "Inconsistent" for incongruence between real-time scarcity and social cue, "Consistent" for congruence between the two.
(2) For study 2, we have 4 conditions. "Control" for real-time scarcity information, "Inconsistent" for incongruence between real-time scarcity and social cue, "Consistent" for congruence between the two, "Ambiguous" for displaying real-time scarcity and different social proof cue (i.e., 50+)
